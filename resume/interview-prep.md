## RightsNavigator Project Deep Dive

*This is your flagship project - be ready to discuss it in detail*

### Project Overview (2-minute pitch)
"During GradInnoHack2025 at UNT, my team and I built RightsNavigator, an AI-powered legal guidance system specifically designed for people with disabilities. The problem we tackled was that legal information is often hard to navigate and not accessible to people with different needs. We created a system that provides personalized legal guidance through an accessible interface that includes voice interaction for users with mobility impairments."

### Technical Implementation
**Architecture Overview:**
- Built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to provide accurate legal information
- Used ChromaDB as our vector database to store and retrieve relevant legal documents
- Implemented LlamaIndex for efficient document indexing and retrieval
- Integrated Llama 3.2 via OLLAMA for natural language generation
- Created a user-friendly interface with Streamlit

**My Specific Contributions:**
- Worked on the RAG pipeline implementation using LlamaIndex
- Helped integrate the language model with our application
- Contributed to the Streamlit interface design and user experience
- Participated in data preparation and testing

### Technical Deep Dive Questions & Answers

**Q: How did you implement the RAG system?**
A: "We used LlamaIndex to create embeddings of legal documents and stored them in ChromaDB. When a user asks a question, we first retrieve the most relevant document chunks based on semantic similarity, then pass both the user's question and the relevant context to Llama 3.2 to generate a comprehensive, accurate response."

**Q: What challenges did you face with the implementation?**
A: "One major challenge was ensuring the accuracy of legal information - we couldn't have the AI making up legal advice. We solved this by being very careful about our retrieval process and clearly indicating when information might need professional legal consultation. Another challenge was making the interface truly accessible, which led us to implement voice interaction features."

**Q: How did you handle the 48-hour time constraint?**
A: "We planned our work carefully and divided responsibilities based on each team member's strengths. I focused on the technical implementation while others worked on research and user interface design. We used git for collaboration and had regular check-ins to make sure we were on track."

**Q: What would you improve about the project?**
A: "Given more time, I'd want to expand the legal database, implement more sophisticated evaluation metrics for response quality, and add features like document upload for personalized legal analysis. I'd also want to conduct more user testing with the disability community to ensure our accessibility features truly meet their needs."

## Technical Questions Preparation

### Python Programming

**Q: Explain how you've used pandas in your projects.**
A: "I've used pandas extensively for data manipulation and analysis. In my academic projects, I used it for cleaning datasets, performing aggregations, and preparing data for machine learning models. I'm comfortable with operations like groupby, merge, and handling missing data."

**Q: Describe your experience with APIs.**
A: "In RightsNavigator, I worked with integrating language model APIs. I've also built simple REST APIs using FastAPI for academic projects. I understand HTTP methods, status codes, and how to handle errors properly."

### Machine Learning

**Q: Walk me through how you would approach a new machine learning problem.**
A: "First, I'd understand the business problem and define success metrics. Then I'd explore the data to understand its structure and quality. I'd start with simple baseline models using scikit-learn before moving to more complex approaches. Throughout the process, I'd focus on proper validation techniques and being able to explain the results clearly."

**Q: What's your experience with different ML algorithms?**
A: "I have hands-on experience with classification and regression algorithms through coursework. I've worked with linear models, decision trees, and ensemble methods. My practical experience is strongest with NLP and language models through the RightsNavigator project."

### Data Analysis

**Q: How do you ensure data quality?**
A: "I start by exploring the data to understand its structure, looking for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. I create summary statistics and visualizations to spot potential issues. I also validate data against business rules when possible."

**Q: Describe a time you found insights in data.**
A: "In one of my academic projects, I was analyzing [specific example]. Through exploratory data analysis, I discovered [insight] which led to [outcome]. This taught me the importance of really understanding your data before jumping into modeling."

### SQL

**Q: Write a query to find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, customer_name, SUM(purchase_amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

## Behavioral Interview Scenarios

### Teamwork and Collaboration

**STAR Method Example - RightsNavigator Team Project**

**Situation:** During the GradInnoHack2025 hackathon, our team of four had to build a complete AI application in just 48 hours.

**Task:** I needed to implement the core RAG functionality while coordinating with teammates working on different components.

**Action:** I took initiative to set up our technical infrastructure and established clear interfaces between components. I communicated regularly about my progress and actively helped teammates when they ran into issues with their parts.

**Result:** We successfully delivered a working application that impressed the judges and provided real value for users with disabilities. Our effective collaboration was key to meeting the tight deadline.

### Problem-Solving

**Situation:** During RightsNavigator development, we realized our initial approach to legal document retrieval wasn't giving accurate enough results.

**Task:** We needed to improve accuracy without completely rewriting our system.

**Action:** I researched different embedding strategies and retrieval methods. I proposed using more specific chunking strategies and better prompt engineering to improve context relevance.

**Result:** Our improved approach significantly enhanced response quality, and we implemented safeguards to clearly indicate when users should seek professional legal advice.

### Learning and Growth

**Situation:** For RightsNavigator, I needed to quickly learn about RAG systems and vector databases, which were new to me.

**Task:** Master these technologies in a short timeframe to contribute meaningfully to the project.

**Action:** I dedicated focused time to understanding the concepts, worked through tutorials, and wasn't afraid to ask for help when stuck. I also documented what I learned to help my teammates.

**Result:** I successfully implemented the RAG pipeline and gained confidence with these technologies, which I now consider one of my strengths.
